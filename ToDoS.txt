!!!CFH (16.09.2024): 

- decrease the punto size of the values in data-preview table in data-collection step 
(couldn't achieve)

- we are still loosing the manually created 'NaN' string category of 
    cateorical features when user clicks 'Stacked wrt Target' checkbox
    Var_11 is an example


- make the checkboxes: 'Outlier Cleaning' and 'Sparsity Cleaning'
    disabled when the selected feature is categorical.
- add a info symbol right-top of the 'Outlier Cleaning' and
    'Sparsity Cleaning' checkboxes and add hovering text effect on 
    them indicating a specific given information lets be 'XYZ' for now
- add a 'Select a Feature' dropdown menu on the feature_name
    as the last <div> where user can change the feature of the
    feature-card
