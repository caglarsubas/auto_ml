!!!CFH (14.09.2024): 

- add legend title 'Target Classes' into the distribution plot when 
    'Stacked wrt Target' selected
- when we selected the 'Stack wrt Target' checkbox for a categorical 
feature, the string 'NaN' category, which is created manually,
disappears in the bar-plot
- make the checkboxes: 'Outlier Cleaning' and 'Sparsity Cleaning'
    disabled when the selected feature is categorical.
- add a info symbol right-top of the 'Outlier Cleaning' and
    'Sparsity Cleaning' checkboxes and add hovering text effect on 
    them indicating a specific given information lets be 'XYZ' for now
- add a 'Select a Feature' dropdown menu on the feature_name
    as the last <div> where user can change the feature of the
    feature-card
